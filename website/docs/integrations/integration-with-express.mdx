[Express is the most popular web framework for Node.js.](https://expressjs.com/) It is a minimalist framework that provides a robust set of features to handle HTTP on Node.js applications.
You can easily integrate GraphQL Yoga into your Express application with a few lines of code.

## Installation

<PackageInstall packages={['express', 'graphql', 'graphql-yoga@alpha']} />

## Example

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { createServer } from 'graphql-yoga'

const app = express()

const graphQLServer = createServer({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    type Query {
      hello: String
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      hello: () => 'world',
    },
  },
})

// Bind GraphQL Yoga to `/graphql` endpoint
// Here it takes the request and response objects and handles them internally
app.use('/graphql', graphQLServer.requestListener)

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

## Accessing the original request and response objects of Express

```ts
// Assume that we are using
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me: async (_, __, { req, res }) => {
      const userId = req.session.userId // We can access Express session that is passed in `req.session`
      // res.header('my-special-header', 'My Special Value') // We can set headers on the response
      const user = await User.findById(userId)
      return user
    },
  },
}
```
